## ðŸ’» Project

This project is video player, where you can chose a video, that is coming from an API inside a fake server, from the main page to watch and with a feature to add videos to a favorite list. My goal with the project was to learn how to better use React Router to navigate between different pages and to get a better understanding on the useEffect hook with using it with an API to get all the videos to the main page
